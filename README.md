Stock Market App
Overview
This project is a web application built using ReactJS for the frontend and Python (Flask) for the backend. The app visualizes stock market data in a table format and allows for CRUD operations. Additionally, it includes a multi-axis chart to display stock closing prices and volume over time. The data is stored in an SQL database and is retrieved and manipulated via a RESTful API.

Features
Table Visualization: Display stock data in a table format with editable rows.
CRUD Operations: Add, update, and delete stock data directly from the frontend.
Multi-Axis Chart: Visualize the closing prices and volume of stocks over time with the ability to filter by trade code.
Dropdown Filter: Filter the chart data based on selected trade code.
Additional Visualizations: (Add any other visualizations you implemented here.)
