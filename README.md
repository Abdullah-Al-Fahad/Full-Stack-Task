# Stock Market App

## Overview

This project is a web application built using **ReactJS** for the frontend and **Python (Flask)** for the backend. The app visualizes stock market data in a table format and allows for CRUD operations. Additionally, it includes a multi-axis chart to display stock closing prices and volume over time. The data is stored in an SQL database and can be retrieved and manipulated.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: SQLite 
- **Charting Library**: Recharts

## The things I learned

- How to setup a react app and app.js is the core component for rendering in the react app directory.
- React uses JSX which is basically mix of javascript and html like syntax.
- Using flask as backend is fairly simple and easy.
- I used lavravel before. It had models , routes, controller as separate files etc and were more complex as far as I remember though it was a way larger project. Flask seems simple.
- Had no idea about how github worked. I thought git and github were the same thing. Learned a little bit about git mechanisms like push, commmit, branching etc.
- Most fun part was deploying it using vercel and pythonanywhere. Never thought having your own website out in the web was that easy.
- Overall it was fun experience.
